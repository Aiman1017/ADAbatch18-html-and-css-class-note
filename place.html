	<p><strong>Sungai Buloh is a city and mukim in Petaling District, Selangor, Malaysia. The name itself means "bamboo river" in the Malay language. It is located along the Kuala Selangor highway.</strong></p>

	<p>In 1930, in an isolated valley of Bukit Lagong, Sungai Buloh, a group of Malays, Chinese, Indians, Eurasians and Turks set up a contained community in the wake of the 1926 Leper Enactment Act, which required the segregation and treatment of those with the disease.

        Sungai Buloh was the <em>second biggest leprosy settlements in the world</em>.It was equipped with advanced facilities and became a research centre for leprosy. Sungei Buloh was <em>a pioneer project based on the "enlightened policy"</em> of segregating leprosy patients in a self-supporting community following the principles of a garden city.

        In 1935 and 1936, scrip was issued specifically for the settlement.

		On May 7, 1991, Sungai Buloh suffered the explosion of the Bright Sparklers Firework factory in the city and the subsequent fire.</p>
